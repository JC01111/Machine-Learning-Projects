# Machine Learning Projects
I included some my machine learning projects here. Each folder has a `.ipynb` file of my work and a `.pdf` version of the jupyternotebook for reading. Notice that some projects do not include datasets, for some datasets you can download from the link in my work.

## Overview:
Here are the links to some famous machine learning tasks.
