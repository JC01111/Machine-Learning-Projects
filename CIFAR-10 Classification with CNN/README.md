## Overview
This project has two files:
1. The [AlexNetwork for CIFAR10.ipynb](https://github.com/JC01111/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/CIFAR-10%20Classification%20with%20CNN/AlexNetwork%20for%20CIFAR10.ipynb) has two parts: 
    - MLP For FashionMNIST
    - CNN For CIFAR-10

I implemented and modified a Convolutional Neural Network to an AlexNetwork to achieve better accuracy on CIFAR-10 classification.

2. The [Basic Network & CNN.ipynb](https://github.com/JC01111/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/CIFAR-10%20Classification%20with%20CNN/Basic%20Network%20%26%20CNN.ipynb) is my implementation of Basic Neural Network and Convolutional Neural Network from scratch.
