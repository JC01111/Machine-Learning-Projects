# Movie Recommender System and Geo-location with k-NN
This project has two parts: 
1. I built a personalized movie recommender system by using SVD to perform Latent Semantic Analysis, and use it to construct a Latent Factor Model (LFM) for personalized recommendation. 
2. I used k-nearest neighbors to predict latitude and longitude coordinates of images from their CLIP embeddings.
