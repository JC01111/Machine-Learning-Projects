## Overview
In this project, I used two different methods: Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (GDA) to classify MNIST and Spam dataset. Each method achieved 94.5% accuracy

Look at [`MNIST_Spam_Classification_with_SVMs.ipynb`](/MNIST%20&%20Spam%20Classification/MNIST_Spam_Classification_with_SVMs.ipynb) for SVMs implementation.

Look at [`MNIST_Spam_Classification_with_GDA.ipynb`](/MNIST%20&%20Spam%20Classification/MNIST_Spam_Classification_with_GDA.ipynb) for GDA implementation.
